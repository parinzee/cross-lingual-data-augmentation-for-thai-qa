# Cross-Lingual Data Augmentation For Thai QA
To be presented at GenBench in EMNLP 2023: `PDF Coming Soon`

TLDR: **This paper introduces an innovative data augmentation framework with quality control measures to enhance the robustness of Thai question answering models.**

> This paper presents an innovative data augmentation framework with data quality control designed to enhance the robustness of Question Answering (QA) models in low-resource languages, particularly Thai. Recognizing the challenges posed by the scarcity and quality of training data, we leverage data augmentation techniques in both monolingual and cross-lingual settings. Our approach augments and enriches the original dataset, thereby increasing its linguistic diversity and robustness. We evaluate the robustness of our framework on Machine Reading Comprehension, and the experimental results illustrate the potential of data augmentation to effectively increase training data and improve model generalization in low-resource language settings, offering a promising direction for the data augmentation manner.
